/**
 * MIDDLEWARES
 * 
 * Purpose: Express middleware functions that process requests
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Authentication/Authorization (JWT, sessions)
 * - Request validation (body, params, query)
 * - Rate limiting
 * - Request logging
 * - Error transformation
 * - File upload handling
 * 
 * Already includes:
 * - errorHandler.js       → Centralized error handling
 * - notFound.js           → 404 handler
 * 
 * Future additions:
 * - auth.js               → Protect routes with JWT
 * - validate.js           → Request schema validation
 * - rateLimiter.js        → API rate limiting
 * - upload.js             → File upload handling
